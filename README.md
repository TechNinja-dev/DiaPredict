# 🩺 DiaPredict - Diabetes Prediction using SVM

DiaPredict is a machine learning project that uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on various medical features. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis using data-driven insights.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 💻 Built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook
- 🔍 Trained on a dataset with health metrics like age, gender, blood glucose levels, BMI, cholesterol, and more
- 🤖 Uses SVM (Support Vector Machine) for classification
- 📈 Achieved an accuracy of **84%**

---

## 🔬 Features Used

- `AGE` – Patient’s age  
- `Gender` – Male/Female (encoded)  
- `Urea`, `Cr`, `HbA1c` – Blood chemistry values  
- `Chol`, `TG`, `HDL`, `LDL`, `VLDL` – Lipid profile  
- `BMI` – Body Mass Index  
- `CLASS` – Target variable (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)
